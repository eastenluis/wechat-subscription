# wechat-subscription

My ultimate goal is creating a RSS generator for a given list of WeChat subscription accounts. The closed environment of WeChat 
makes it difficult for readers to read, save or share the articles from subscription accounts. And I personally prefer reading 
experience on RSS readers (e.g. Reeder on iOS, or Press on Android). So I am writing this to help populate a RSS feed that 
can be easily subscribed by these RSS clients.

I use TypeScript here just for practice.
